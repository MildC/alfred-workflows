Alfred Workflows
================
Workflows for [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) 2.

Run Terminal Command Here
---
![Run Terminal Command Here Screenshot](screenshots/cdh_git-status.png)

Run a Terminal command in your currently open Finder directory by using keyword `cdh` and the Terminal command you want to run: "cdh [your command]". If you don't supply a command, the Terminal will cd into your currently open Finder directory.

If there is no folder currently open in Finder, your command will be run in your Desktop folder.

The workflow will by default execute your command in the first non-busy Terminal window it finds, otherwise open a new one.


**Update March-17-2013**

Added option: To explicitly run the command in a new Terminal window, press [alt] when firing your command in Alfred 2.

***Note:
Both Open-With-Sublime-Text Workflows come with `subl`, Sublime's CL Tool name, as their keyword.
